# A Hobbyist's Guide to HTML5 Game Development

In the course of developing my [to-be-commercialized HTML5 game](http://www.ludosquest.com/), I learned a whole lot of things. Some technical, some inspirational, and some marketing. This is a collection of those articles I picked up along the way. Feel free to fork and add your own.

P.S. What I've learned are two lessons:

1. You need a great game (develop, test and iterate a lot).
2. You need to market it really, really, REALLY well.

In today's Internet age, a lone wolf can do both. You just need lots of time and dedication. And a bit of luck of course.

## Inspirational
- [Gamasutra Blog](http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs). Especially the Member Blog section. Lots of insight, post-mortems, lessons learned and personal stories. I'm an addict and read everyday.

## Going Native
If you want to make money, this route is a must.

## Javascript Technical

## Assets - Graphics and Music
- [Game Dev Market](https://www.gamedevmarket.net/). Great and cheap game assets.
- [Graphic River](http://graphicriver.net/category/game-assets). More complete library of assets but a bit mor expensive.
- [Game Art 2D](http://www.gameart2d.com/). Alias pzUH on Graphic River, Sellfy, etc. Great stuff.
- [Harry Mack - Game Audio Designer](http://www.harrymack.com/listen.html). I do find a lot of game music suck - sounds all the same (espcially for kids). Harry Mack brings up some good points that resonate with me [in this article](http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/HarryMack/20150424/241874/GettingMaking_Game_Music_that_Fits__Comparative_Music_Series__Kids_vs_Kids.php) so he gets my vote.
- [Classical Piano Music](http://www.piano-midi.de/). Popular music is all about a catchy melodie. Listen from the greats from inspiration.
